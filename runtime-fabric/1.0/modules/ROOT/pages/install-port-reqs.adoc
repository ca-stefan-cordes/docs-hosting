== Additional Ports Used During Installation

The following table lists the ports that must be accessible when installing Anypoint Runtime Fabric. After completing the installation, you can safely disable these ports.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Port | Protocol | Direction | Description
| 61008-61010 | TCP (HTTPS) | Internal | Used during installation
| 61022-61024 | TCP (HTTPS) | Internal | Installer agent ports
| 4242 | TCP | Internal | Bandwidth checker

== Port IPs and Hostnames to Whitelist

In your network, you may need to whitelist the hostnames and ports of various parts of the Anypoint Platform to allow Anypoint Runtime Fabric to communicate with the MuleSoft-managed online Anypoint Platform APIs and services, and to download dependencies during installation or upgrades.

These tables show you the ports and hostnames to add to your whitelists to allow communication between Runtime Fabric and Anypoint Platform:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Port | Protocol | Hostnames
| 5672 | TCP (AMQP) | `transport-layer.prod.cloudhub.io`
| 443 | HTTPS | `*.prod.cloudhub.io`
| 443 | HTTPS | `anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| 443 | HTTPS | `*.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
| 443 | HTTPS | `kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com`
| 443 | HTTPS | `worker-cloud-helm-prod.s3.amazonaws.com`
| 443 | HTTPS | `docker-images-prod.s3.amazonaws.com`
.2+| 443 .2+| HTTPS | US control plane: `ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
| EU control plane: `ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`
.2+| 443 .2+| HTTPS | US control plane: `*.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
| EU control plane: `*.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`
.2+| 443 .2+| HTTPS | US control plane: `prod-us-east-1-starport-layer-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com`
| EU control plane: `prod-eu-central-1-starport-layer-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com`
