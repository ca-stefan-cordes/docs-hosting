This topic describes how to configure Anypoint Runtime Fabric to send alerts through an existing SMTP server. Runtime Fabric comes bundled with alerts to raise visibility when its health may be compromised.

== Procedure

. Using a terminal, open a shell/SSH connection to a controller VM.
. Create a file named `alert-smtp.yaml`.
. Add the following content to this file after customizing based on the table below:
+
----
kind: smtp
version: v2
metadata:
  name: smtp
spec:
  host: <smtp host>
  port: <smtp port>
  username: <username>
  password: <password>
---
kind: alerttarget
version: v2
metadata:
  name: email-alerts
spec:
  email: <email>
----
+
Using the following values specific to your environment:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Key | Description
|`smtp.host` | The endpoint of the SMTP server.
|`<smtp port>` | The port used to connect to the SMTP server. (465 by default).
|`<username>` | The username to use when connecting to the SMTP server.
|`<password>` | The password to use when connecting to the SMTP server.
|`<email>` | The recipient email address.

|===
+
. Run the following command on the controller VM, referencing the file created earlier.
----
$ gravity resource create -f alert-smtp.yaml
----

Alerts should now be configured to send through your STMP server.
