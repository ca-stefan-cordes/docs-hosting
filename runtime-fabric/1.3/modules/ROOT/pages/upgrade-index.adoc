= Upgrade Runtime Fabric

Anypoint Runtime Fabric is a package of components that work together. Updates are delivered to these components in the following methods:

* Cluster-level components are delivered as an updated installer package. These components include Docker, Kubernetes, and the Ops Center.

* Runtime Fabric components are delivered via Anypoint Runtime Manager in Anypoint Platform. These components include the agent used to connect Runtime Fabric to Anypoint Platform.

* Node configuration changes are reflected in newer versions of the installer scripts, and are also delivered via the `rtfctl` command-line utility. These changes include adjusting operating system limits and performing jobs to clean up system resources.

* The `rtfctl` command-line utility upgrades are provided as a new binary that replaces the existing binary. The `rtfctl` utility is used to manage Runtime Fabric locally.

Upgrades to cluster-level and node configuration components are performed using the `rtfctl` command-line utility.
