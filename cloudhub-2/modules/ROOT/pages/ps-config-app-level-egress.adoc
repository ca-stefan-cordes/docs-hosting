= Configuring Application Level Egress Rules
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

Application level egress rules are independent of private space level firewall rules. For an egress traffic to go through, it must pass both private space and application level control.


== Before You Begin

* Set up your private space and complete the provisioning of your private network.
* Verify that your account has CloudHub Network Viewer permission, which is required to view a private space's firewall and application level rules.
* Verify that your account has CloudHub Network Administrator permission, which is required to modify a private space's firewall and application level rules.

== Configure Application Level Rules in Your Private Space

To configure the application level groups in a private space:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager* > *Private Spaces*.
. Click the name of the private space to manage.
. On the *Firewall rules* tab, expand the *App-Level Rules* section.

By default, the application level egress rules feature is disabled when you create a new private space. Toggle the feature to enable it.

[NOTE]
Ensure that you have completed the provisioning of your private network before enabling the toggle.

Toggling the *App-Level Egress Rules* feature enables the *Default-Egress-Rule-Group*. The default egress rule is *Allow any protocol to any destination*.

To modify the default egress rule group:

. Click *Edit*.
+
The rule group configuration window opens.
. In the *Egress Rules* section, use the drop-down list to select the desired protocol and destination.
. Click *Add Rule* to add new rules to the rule group.
+ 
You can delete rules by clicking the delete button image:trash-icon.png[Delete button, 2%,2%].
. Click *Update Egress Rules* to save your changes.
+
Your changes will affect all the applications in the current private space.
+
[NOTE]
You can neither rename nor delete the default rule group.

To create a new custom egress rule group:

. Click *Create Rule Group*.
+
The rule group configuration window opens.
. Add a group name.
+ 
You can edit and rename custom rule groups. 
. In the *Egress Rules* section, click *Add Rule* and use the dropdown list to select the desired protocol and destination.
. Click *Add Rule* to add new rules to the new rule group.
+ 
You can delete rules by clicking the delete button image:trash-icon.png[Delete button, 2%,2%].
. Click *Create Egress Rules* to save your changes.
+
When created, new rule groups are not used by any apps. To use your custom rule groups, you must select them in the applications settings.

To delete an existing custom rule group: 

. Select *Delete* from the *More actions* menu image:more-icon.png[More actions menu, 2%,2%]. 
. When prompted, click *Delete Rule Group* to confirma the deletion.
+
[NOTE]
Once you delete a rule group, any applications using it immediately starts using the default egress rule group instead.

You can disable the application level egress rule feature by clicking the feature's toggle feature. When prompted, click *Delete and Disable App-Level Rules* to confirm. 

[NOTE]
Once you disable the feature, all the custom app-level egress rule groups are deleted, and all app-level egress is allowed for all applications.

== Apply Application Level Egress Rules When Deploying Your Applications

You can apply the app-level egress rules that you configured in your private space when you deploy an application:

. When deploying an application to your private space, go to the *Firewall Rules* tab.
+
The *Egress Rule Group* section shows all the rule groups configured for the selected private space.
. Use the dropdown to select the egress ruleset you want to apply to your application. 
+
The selected rule group's details appear below the *Egress Rule Group* list.
. Click *Apply Changes* to apply the selected egress rules to your application.


== Configure Application Egress Connection to Anypoint MQ or ObjectStore v2

To set up connections to Anypoint MQ or OSv2, and access external endpoints, such as `anypoint.mulesoft.com` , you can follow the steps provided in this section.

[NOTE]
You must also allow outbound access to all 443 at the private space level separately.

To allow HTTPS connections to OSv2, add an app-level egress rule group with the following rule:

* Protocol: `HTTPS`
* Destination: `[Custom Domains]`
** With value
*** For prod: `anypoint.mulesoft.com`
*** For prod-eu: `eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
* Port Range: `443`

To allow HTTPS connections to Anypoint MQ, add an app-level egress rule group with the following two rules:

. Allow egress to Anypoint control plane:
** Protocol: `HTTPS`
** Destination: `[Custom Domains]`
*** With value
**** For prod: `anypoint.mulesoft.com`
**** For prod-eu: `eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
** Port Range: `443`
. Allow egress to MQ destination:
** Protocol: HTTPS
** Destination: `[Custom Domains]`
*** With value of the domain name configured in MQ connector URL
+
For example, if the MQ connector URL is `https://mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/{{anypointOrgId}}/environments/{{anypointEnvId}}/`,
use value `mq-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`.
** Port Range 443
. Allow egress to Object Store v2 destination
** Protocol: `HTTPS`
** Destination: `[Custom Domains}`
*** With value
**** For prod: `object-store-us-east-1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
**** For prod-eu: `[xxx]`
** Port Range: `443`

[NOTE]
If you enable egress for a domain that includes redirection, such as when `https://salesforce.com` redirects to `https://www.salesforce.com`, ensure to allow egress for both the original target, `salesforce.com`, and the redirected target, `www.salesforce.com`.

You can add application level egress support for API Manage. To configure application egress connection to API Manager, use value `anypoint.mulesoft.com` for the destination on port range 443.


== Performance Impact

Given the extra layer of validation, using the application level egress rules can introduce three to ten-minute network latency delays to your applications' connections. To balance security and performance:

* Limit active rule groups to 20 in your private space.
* Use a maximum of 40 rules per rule group.
* Limit the total combination of rule group and rules to 800. 
+
You can customize the number of rule groups and rules in the combination based on your needs.

These measures help optimize latency while maintaining effective network security.

[NOTE]
DNS record timing issues can sometimes lead to unexpected connectivity errors. To enhance the reliability of Mule applications, ensure to implement robust error handling and connection retry mechanisms.
