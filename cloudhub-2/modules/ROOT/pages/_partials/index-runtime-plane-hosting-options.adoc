// RUNTIME PLANE HOSTING OPTIONS 
// tag::runtimePlaneHostingOptions[]
MuleSoft provides different options for hosting the Anypoint Platform runtime plane:

* CloudHub 2.0
+
CloudHub 2.0 is a fully managed, containerized integration platform as a service (iPaaS) where you can deploy APIs and integrations as lightweight containers in the cloud.
+
CloudHub 2.0 provides for deployments across 12 regions globally, either single or shared tenancy, and dynamically scales infrastructure and built-in services up or down to support elastic transaction volumes.
See xref:cloudhub-2::index.adoc[CloudHub 2.0] for more information.
* CloudHub 1.0
+
CloudHub is MuleSoft's cloud-based environment for hosting the Mule runtime server and related services. CloudHub enables you to deploy an API or a Mule application on a platform that's managed by MuleSoft.
+
CloudHub also provides high availability, clustering and failover of your APIs and Mule applications and performs load balancing for them. See xref:runtime-manager::cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] for more information.
+
CloudHub can be managed only by version of the cloud control plane that exists in the same environment (US cloud, EU cloud, or MuleSoft Government Cloud).

* Runtime Fabric
+
Runtime Fabric is a container service that enables you to run Mule applications and API gateways within a data center or third-party cloud environment that you control and manage. You can install Runtime Fabric on a set of physical servers, virtual machines, or within Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
+
Runtime Fabric comes bundled with technology such as Docker and Kubernetes, which offer benefits such as high availability, failover, clustering, and load balancing. See xref:runtime-fabric::index.adoc[Anypoint Runtime Fabric Overview] for more information.
+
Runtime Fabric can be managed only by Cloud control planes (US cloud, EU cloud). MuleSoft Government Cloud and Anypoint Platform PCE do not support Runtime Fabric.

* Standalone Runtimes
+
The standalone option enables you to host Mule runtime engine server and related services in an environment that you manage. Using standalone runtimes, the Mule runtime server can run on a physical server, a virtual machine, or within a third-party cloud installation like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure.
+
When using standalone runtimes, you are also responsible for providing the framework for high availability, failover, clustering and load balancing. See xref:mule-runtime::mule-standalone.adoc[Run Mule Runtime Engine On-Premises].
+
You can manage standalone runtimes by using cloud control planes (US Cloud, EU Cloud, MuleSoft Government Cloud) or a customer-hosted control plane (Anypoint Platform PCE).
