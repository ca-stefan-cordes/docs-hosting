Anypoint Runtime Manager provides an interface you use to manage your on-premises Mule runtime engine instances (servers). You can manage servers either individually or in server groups or clusters.

Servers communicate with Runtime Manager using Runtime Manager agent. After adding a server, use Runtime Manager to deploy applications to the Mule instance. You can also view information about the environment where you installed Mule.

For each Mule instance that you want to manage, add a server to Runtime Manager. In environments with multiple Mule instances, use server groups and clusters for redundancy, high availability, and ease of management.
