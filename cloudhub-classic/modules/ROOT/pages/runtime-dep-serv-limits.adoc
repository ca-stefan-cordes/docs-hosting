To ensure platform stability and performance, Anypoint Platform provides the following recommended and hard limits on the number of deployments, targets, and servers in a hybrid deployment scenario. These limits are specific to an environment in a business group.

[NOTE]
A _target_ is any destination for a Mule app, such as a server group, cluster, or on-premises Mule instance.
For example, a server group comprised of 8 servers (Mule instances) constitutes a single target.

To create additional deployments or servers beyond these limits, you can use different accounts, environments, or business groups. To exceed these limits within the same environment, contact your customer success representative.

The recommended limits on the number of deployments in a hybrid deployment scenario are:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Component | Recommended Limit
| Maximum number of deployments per environment | 1000
| Maximum number of deployments per hybrid target (not Runtime Fabric) | 200
| Maximum deployment size | 200 MB
|===

The hard limits on the number of targets and servers in a hybrid deployment scenario are:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Component | Hard Limit
| Maximum number of targets (not Runtime Fabric) | 500
| Maximum number of servers per server group | 20
| Maximum number of servers per cluster | 8
|===

As an example, if you have 500 clusters (targets) with 8 servers each, the maximum number of servers is 4000.
