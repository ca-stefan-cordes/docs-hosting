Before you set up your private network, use the checklists to gather information you'll need 
from your network administrator.

== Region 

The complete list of supported regions is:

|Region|Sub-Domain
|US East (North Virginia)| `us-e1.cloudhub.io`
|US East (Ohio)| `us-e2.cloudhub.io`

|Asia Pacific (Tokyo)| `jp-e1.cloudhub.io`
|Asia Pacific (Sydney)| `au-s1.cloudhub.io`
|Asia Pacific (Singapore)| `sg-s1.cloudhub.io`
|===

== CIDR Block 

The CIDR block is the range of IP addresses, in CIDR notation, that the apps deployed in your private network use. 

Because each app uses multiple IP addresses, allocate at least 10 IP addresses for each app.

For example, to grant your private network 256 IP addresses between `10.111.0.0` and `10.111.0.255`, set the CIDR block to `10.111.0.0/24`.

When specifying CIDR blocks, ensure that the CIDR blocks:

* Are from a private IP space.
* Don't overlap with any other CIDR blocks in your private spaces.
* Don't overlap with any CIDR blocks in use in your corporate network.

== ASN 

The Autonomous System Number (ASN) specifies the collection of routing prefixes.
For dynamic routing, configure both a remote and local ASN. 

Remote ASN::
The ASN corresponding to your backend.
You can use an existing ASN assigned to your network or a private ASN (64512–65534) that is not already assigned to your network.
The default value is 65001.
Local ASN::
An ASN for the MuleSoft side.
Use a private ASN (64512–65534) that is not already assigned to your network.
The default value is 64512.

== Static IP Prefixes

A maximum of 95 route table entries is allowed per private network,
regardless of the number of VPN connections.
To avoid exceeding the limit, consolidate networks to the fewest number possible.


== Custom Tunnel Configuration

Inside IP CIDRs::
+
--
For each tunnel, enter the IP address range for the internal address of the VPN tunnel.

You can specify a size /30 CIDR block from the `169.254.0.0/16` range.
The CIDR block must be unique across all private network connections.

You cannot use the following CIDR blocks:
----
169.254.0.0/30
169.254.1.0/30
169.254.2.0/30
169.254.3.0/30
169.254.4.0/30
169.254.5.0/30
169.254.169.252/30
----
--
Pre-shared keys::
+
--
For static connections, your VPN endpoint uses pre-shared keys (PSKs) to establish IKE Security Associations.

For each tunnel, enter a value of between 8-64 characters that does not begin with zero (0).
Use only alphanumeric characters, periods (.), and underscores (&#95;). 
--

== Internal DNS Servers 

You can specify custom private domains by adding the IP address and domain name for your network.
When you provide private domains, your worker resolves them using your private DNS,
so you can still use the internal host names of your private network
(make sure your applications call the backend resources by FQDN).

IP addresses::
Up to three IP addresses of your internal DNS server.

// Add IP addresses for internal DNS servers, separated by commas. Multiple servers are allowed for redundancy. They should each support all domains added below.

Domains::
The common portion of your internal domain name, such as `mulesoft.com`

// Add domains to be resolved by internal DNS, separated by commas.
