Anypoint Flex Gateway runs in two modes:

== Local Mode

You can download Anypoint Flex Gateway and install it on a Linux server, VM, or Kubernetes cluster to immediately start applying out-of-the-box policies to non-Mule APIs running on those targets through declarative configuration files.

[NOTE]
Local Mode flex gateways do not show in Anypoint Runtime Manager.

== Connected Mode

Connected Mode Flex Gateway enables you to: 

* Configure Anypoint Flex Gateway to surface your gateways in Runtime Manager, and their APIs and policy configurations in API Manager
* Manage all your non-Mule APIs from a single unified control plane
* Get monitoring and reusability capabilities through API Monitoring and Exchange.
