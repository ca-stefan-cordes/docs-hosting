== Workflow

. Create the private network.
. Configure internal DNS servers, if necessary. 
* Create the VPN. 
* Connect the VPN to your corporate network.
* Customize the private space.


== Before You Begin

* Complete the network admin checklists:

** xref:network-admin-checklist.adoc#private-network-checklist[Private Network Checklist]
** xref:network-admin-checklist.adoc#vpn-checklist[VPN Checklist] 
** xref:network-admin-checklist.adoc#vpn-connection-checklist[VPN Connection Checklist]

* Assign roles and permissions


== Create the Private Space 

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Private Spaces* in the left menu.
. Click *Create private space*.
. Enter a name for your private space and click *Create*.
+
Private space names can contain up to 60 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), spaces, and hyphens (-).
Runtime Manager supports Unicode characters in private space names.
+
The private space name appears in the list when you select a deployment target for your apps.


== Create the Private Network

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Private Spaces* in the left menu.
. Click the name of the private space you want to manage.
. In the *Private network* tab, click *Create network* under *Private network*. 
. Select the region. 
. Enter the CIDR block.
+
The CIDR block is the range of IP addresses that your apps can use.
// Apps use multiple IPs, so allow IPs for roughly 10 times the number of apps you expect to deploy. Donâ€™t overlap with blocks already in use.
. Click *Create*.

If the private network creation fails, click *Retry* to try again.

=== Configure Internal DNS Servers

If your corporate network uses internal DNS servers to resolve requests to custom domains,
enter the IP addresses and domain names.

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Private Spaces* in the left menu.
. Click the name of the private space you want to manage.
. In the *Private network* tab, click the *Configure* link under *Private network*.
. Enter the IP addresses (comma-separated) for your internal DNS servers.
. Enter the domain names (comma-separated) to be resolved by internal DNS.
. Click *Create*.

== Create the VPN

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Private Spaces* in the left menu.
. Click the name of the private space you want to manage.
. In the *Private network* tab, click *Create VPN* under *Next Step*.
. Enter the remote IP address (a single, static IP address) for your VPN endpoint.
. Select the routing type:
+
** *Dynamic*
+
Select this option if your device supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
** *Static*
+
... Specify the static IP prefixes (comma-separated) in CIDR notation.
... Enter a local private ASN that isn't already assigned to your network.
. Select the tunnel configuration:
+
** *Automatic*
+
This option requires no further configuration.
** *Custom*
+
... Specify the IP ranges (in CIR forma) for the internal address of each VPN tunnel.
... Specify the PSKs for each VPN tunnel. 
. Click *Create*. 

// If the VPN creation fails, click *Retry* to try again.


== Connect the VPN to Your Corporate Network 


// Connecting your VPN to your corporate network is done outside of Anypoint Platform. Tell us about your gateway device to get a customized guide for you or your network admin to follow.


. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Private Spaces* in the left menu.
. Click the name of the private space you want to manage.
. In the *Private network* tab, click *View guide* under *Last Step*.

. Click *View guide*.
. Select the *Device vendor*, *Device platform*, and *Device software* from the drop-down lists.
+
The dialog displays the customized configuration file for your gateway device.
+
. Click *Copy* to copy and paste the configuration or *Download* to download the file to your local system.
. Click *Done*.
. Give the configuration information to your network administrator to use when configuring your gateway device.
+
