CloudHub 2.0 supports protecting application property values
so that the property name is visible in Anypoint Runtime Manager, 
but the value is not displayed or retrievable by any user.
CloudHub 2.0 resolves the property at runtime without exposing the sensitive information.

Internally, protected app values are encrypted and stored in the Anypoint Security secrets manager, which is encrypted per user organization.

[IMPORTANT]
Protected property values are a separate feature and concept from the encrypted Mule application properties that are stored in secure configuration files. 
See https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/secure-configuration-properties[Secure Configuration Properties^] (link out from Beta docs).



== Protect Property Values in Runtime Manager

If you protect a property value, users can't view or retrieve the property.

. In the navigation menu, click *Settings*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab.

. Click *Apply Changes*. 
. Redeploy or restart the app.

After redeploying your app, navigate to the *Properties* tab.
The values for properties that you marked as protected are now no longer visible to you or any other user.

In the following example, the values for `birthdate` and `password` are protected but `username` is not:

.The arrow shows the protected values in the *Properties* tab on the application *Settings* page.

After you commit the values and upload the app, the protected property values
don't appear in the console and aren't sent and received between the console and CloudHub.

After you set the property value, you can't retrieve it.
However, you can overwrite the property value with a new value. 
To update a value, enter a new value into the field.

After deploying the app with protected property values,
CloudHub 2.0 maintains the protection for those values.
Even if you edit your application file to remove the `secureProperties` definitions from your `mule-artifact.json` file and then upload that edited application file to CloudHub 2.0, the property values remain protected.


== Copy Protected Property Values between Sandboxes

When moving applications between sandboxes, the name of the property is copied, but the value is left blank.
