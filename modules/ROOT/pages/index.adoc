== What is a Private Space?

A _private space_ is a virtual, private, and isolated network hosted in the Runtime Fabric Cloud into which you deploy your apps.

Anypoint VPN (virtual private network) connects your private intranet to your private space to function as a single, private network. 
The VPN enables apps in the private space to access resources in your on-premises data centers behind your corporate firewall.
The VPN connection comprises two VPN tunnels between the private space in Anypoint Platform and a _gateway device_, a physical or software appliance located in your network.

When you create the private space, you associate a range of IP addresses for the apps in your private space to use and the region where they run. 
Private spaces support Amazon regions.
You can configure multiple private spaces in a single Amazon region, enabling you to set up separate isolated networks for your production and non-production environments, 
such as QA or staging.

You control the traffic to and from your private spaces. 
By default, Runtime Fabric Cloud blocks all traffic to the private space and provides firewall rules to allow connections through specified ports. 
You can configure additional firewall rules to control traffic to your private space, expose or block your custom ports, and block requests to your apps. 

The private space includes dedicated load balancers (DLB), which routes traffic to the private space.
You can configure DLBs to validate requests using your custom SSL certificates and enforce two-way SSL client authentication.
DLBs also enable you to map input URLs to call specific applications within the private space. 
With proxy rules, you can map your applications to a custom domain and host your apps under a single, vanity domain.


By combining firewall rules and DLB configuration, you can fine-tune how external services reach your applications.
