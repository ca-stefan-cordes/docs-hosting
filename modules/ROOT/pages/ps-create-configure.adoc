= Create and Configure the Private Space
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]


To extend your network to Anypoint Platform, create a _private space_, 
a virtual, private, and isolated network hosted in CloudHub 2.0,
to deploy your apps to.


== Create a Private Space 

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
. Click *Create private space*.
. Enter a xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#name[name] for your private space and click *Create*.


== Create a Private Network

[IMPORTANT]
You can't change the private network configuration after it's created.
To change the configuration, delete the private network and create it again.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. In the *Private network* tab, click *Create Private Network*. 
. In the *Create Private Network* page:
.. Select the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#region[region] where you want your apps to run.
.. Enter the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#cidr-block[CIDR block], which is the range of IP addresses that your apps can use.
.. Click *Create*.
+
The private network can take up to 30 minutes to create.
+
While the network is created, you can 
<<Create a Connection to an External Network,create a connection to an external network>>.
. After the network creation succeeds, xref:ps-deploy.adoc#deploy-an-app-to-a-private-space[deploy an application] to test the private network.

If the private network creation fails, delete it and click *Create Private Network* to try again.

=== Resolve Private Domains in Your Internal Network

If your corporate network uses internal DNS servers to resolve requests to custom domains, configure the private space with these IP addresses and domain names.
The private space uses your internal DNS to resolve internal host names of your private network (make sure your applications call the backend resources by FQDN).

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. In the *Private network* tab, click the *Configure* link for *Internal DNS servers*.
. Enter the (comma-separated) xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#server-ip-addresses[server IP addresses] for your internal DNS servers.
. Enter the (comma-separated) xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#domains[domain addresses] to be resolved by internal DNS.
. Click *Create*.

After you configure internal DNS, the *Private network* tab indicates the number of server IP addresses and domains:

== Create a Connection to an External Network

After you create your private network, connect it to an external network using a 
VPN or transit gateway attachment.

//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
. In the *Private network* tab, click *Create Connection*. 
. In the *Create Connection* page:
+
--

== Create a VPN

[NOTE]
After you create a VPN, you can't change any of the VPN settings,
except the static IP prefixes for static routing.

On the *Create VPN* page:

. Enter the 
xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#remote-ip-address[remote IP address] (a single, static IP address) for your VPN endpoint.
. Select the routing type:
+
xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#dynamic-vpn-routing-bgp[Dynamic (BGP)]::
Select this option if your device supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
BGP supports automatic failover for redundant connections.
+
.. In the *Local ASN* field, enter a xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#local-asn[local private ASN] that isn't already assigned to your network.
+
include::partial$caveats.adoc[tag=localAsnNote]
.. In the *Remote ASN* field, enter a xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#remote-asn[private ASN].
+
Click *Show Existing Routes for this Network* to view the existing routes for the private network.

xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#static-vpn-routing[Static]::
Select this option if your device doesn't support BGP.
+
.. In the *Local ASN* field, enter a xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#local-asn[local private ASN] that isn't already assigned to your network.
+
If you have already created a VPN in this private space, the *Create VPN* page doesn't display the *Local ASN* field.
+
.. In the *Static Routes* field, specify the (comma-separated) xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#static-ip-prefixes[static IP prefixes] in CIDR notation.
+
Click *Show Existing Routes for this Network* to view the existing routes for the private network.

. Select the tunnel configuration:
+
Automatic::
This option requires no further configuration.
All values are auto-generated.
xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#custom-tunnel-configuration-optional[Custom]::
Any values that you don't specify are autogenerated.
+
.. Specify the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#inside-ip-cidrs[IP ranges] (in CIDR format) for the internal address of each VPN tunnel.
.. Specify the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#pre-shared-keys[pre-shared keys] (PSKs) for each VPN tunnel.

. Click *Create VPN*. 
+
The VPN can take up to 15 minutes to create.
+
While the VPN is created, you can <<Create a Redundant VPN,create a redundant VPN>>.

After the VPN creation completes successfully,
the tunnel status is *Down* until you 
<<Connect a VPN to Your Corporate Network,,connect the VPN
to your corporate network>>:

image::vpn-down.png[Tunnel status in the VPN section]

Connecting the VPN involves configuring your gateway device. 

If the VPN creation fails, click *Create VPN* to try again.


=== Create a Redundant VPN

Redundant VPNs inherit some settings from the intial VPN configuration automatically.

[NOTE]
After you create a redundant VPN, you can't change any of the settings.


. In the *Private network* tab, click *Create Redundant VPN*.
. In the *Create Redundant VPN* page, complete the fields, based on the routing type of the initial VPN:
+
Dynamic (BGP)::
+
.. In the *Remote IP* field, Enter the public IP address 
(a single, static IP address that isn't used by other VPNs) of your VPN endpoint.
.. In the *Remote ASN* field, enter a private ASN.
+
By default, *Remote ASN* contains the value from the first VPN, but you can change this value.
Static::
+
In the *Remote IP* field, enter the public IP address 
(a single, static IP address that isn't used by other VPNs) of your VPN endpoint.
+
Because you have already created a VPN in this private space, the *Create VPN* page doesn't display the *Local ASN* field.
. Select the tunnel configuration:
+
Automatic::
This option requires no further configuration.
All values are auto-generated.
Custom::
+
.. Specify the IP ranges (in CIDR format) for the internal address of each VPN tunnel.
.. Specify the PSKs for each VPN tunnel.
. Click *Create Redundant VPN*. 

The redundant VPN can take up to 15 minutes to create.

If the redundant VPN creation fails, click *Create Redundant VPN* to try again.


=== Connect a VPN to Your Corporate Network 

To connect the VPN to your corporate network, you or your network administrator must configure
your gateway device outside of Anypoint Platform.

To facilitate this configuration, you provide information about your gateway device, which
Anypoint Platform uses to generate a connection guide to use to configure your device. 


//SELECT PRIVATE SPACE SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectPrivateSpace]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickPrivateSpaceName]
. In the *Private network* tab, click *View Connection Guide*.
. In the *VPN Connection Guide* page, select the *Device vendor*, *Device platform*, and *Device software* from the drop-down lists.
. Click *Download Guide*.
+
The connection guide, in `.txt` format, downloads to your local system.
. Give the connection guide to your network administrator to use to configure your gateway device.
+
For information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/adminguide/Welcome.html[Your customer gateway device] in the AWS VPN documentation.


=== Test a VPN Connection 

// (Link from *Private network* tab?)

To test the VPN connection, use the Network Tools Application. 

For download and usage information about the Network Tools Application, see https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/How-To-Use-Network-Tools-Application[How To Use Network Tools Application].

== Create a Transit Gateway Attachment

// figure out how to share this entire bit with CH 1.0.

On the *Create Transit Gateway Attachment* page:

. Specify a xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#transit-gateway-name[name] for your transit gateway.
+
Use the same name for your transit gateway in AWS.
You can change this name later. 
. Select the xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#transit-gateway-region[region] that corresponds to the location your AWS transit gateway.
+
Your private space and AWS transit gateway must be in the same region.
. Click *Next*.
+
The *Add transit gateway* page lists the steps to create a resource share in AWS.

=== Create a Resource Share

. Sign in to your AWS corporate account.
. In Anypoint Platform, click the *Create Resource Share* link on the *Add transit gateway* page. 
+
The link opens the AWS RAM console to the page for creating a resource share in the region you specified.

--
. In Anypoint Platform, in the *Add transit gateway* window: 
+
--
.. Click *Next*.
.. Paste the values you copied from AWS in the *ID* and *Owner* fields.

*** The resource share *ID* field contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-).
*** The resource share *Owner* field contains only numbers.

.. Click *Add*.
--
+
The *Transit Gateways* page shows the progress for connecting to AWS and adding the transit gateway to Anypoint Platform.

When the transit gateway addition succeeds, the *Transit Gateways* page displays the *Transit gateway added* message.
The *Transit Gateways* page updates the owner and ID from AWS and the State as *Available*.

// image::tgw-resource-share-available.png[Transit gateway added]

// If the transit gateway addition fails, see xref:tgw-troubleshoot.adoc[Troubleshoot Transit Gateway Attachments].

=== Attach a Private Space to the Transit Gateway

After the transit gateway attachment succeeds, you can attach your private space.

To attach a private space to the transit gateway:

. In Anypoint Platform, on the *Transit Gateways* page, click *Attach Private Space*.
+
The *Attach Private Space* button is disabled if no private spaces are available to attach or if the transit gateway addition failed. 
. From the *Select Private Space* window, select the private space to attach.
+
The window displays only the private spaces that you manage in the same region as the transit gateway.
The window doesn't display private spaces:
+
--
* In other regions
* Already attached to a transit gateway
* In Business Groups for which you don't have Cloudhub Network Administrator permissions
--
. Click *Next*.
. Sign in to your AWS corporate account.
. In the *Accept VPC Attachment* window: 
+
.. Click the *Transit Gateway Attachments* link. 
+
The link opens the AWS RAM console to the page for accepting the transit gateway attachments in the region you specified.
.. On the *Transit Gateway Attachments* page, select the attachment that shows *pending* in the *State* column.
+
The attachment might take a few minutes to appear.
+
To verify that the attachment is correct, select the Transit Gateway attachment ID and, in the *Details* tab, ensure that the *Resource owner account ID* is the MuleSoft AWS account ID from the *Add transit gateway* page.
.. From the *Actions* menu, select *Accept*.
. In Anypoint Platform, in the *Accept Private Space Attachment* window, click *Done*.
+
The *Transit Gateways* page shows the progress for accepting the attachment from Anypoint Platform to AWS.

When the attachment succeeds, the *Transit Gateways* page displays the *Private space attached* message, and the private space shows the `Attached successfully` message.

// If the attachment fails, see xref:tgw-troubleshoot.adoc[Troubleshoot Transit Gateway Attachments].

=== Add Routes to the Transit Gateway Route Table

After the *Private space attached* message appears, you can add routes so apps deployed to the private space can access the transit gateway.

To add routes to the transit gateway route table:

. On the *Transit Gateways* page, in the *Private spaces* section, click *Add Route*. 
. In the *Add private space route* window, enter a single subnet in CIDR notation.
+
For information, see xref:ps-gather-setup-info.adoc#transit-gateway-routing[Transit Gateway Routing].
. Click *Add route*.
+
Anypoint Platform submits the new route to AWS.

When the route addition succeeds, the *Transit Gateways* page shows the *Route added* message
and the *Transit Gateways* page shows the route CIDR in the route table.

In the route table, added routes show *Transit Gateway* as the value in the *Next hop* column.
