Anypoint Flex Gateway is a lightweight standalone gateway that can serve as a proxy for any API, including non-Mule APIs.
It can run on major Linux distributions, as a containerized application using a MuleSoft supported OCI image, and as a Kubernetes-native ingress controller or API gateway.

Unlike the existing API gateway, which is embedded into Mule Runtime and depends on Mule applications to work, Anypoint Flex Gateway has a small footprint that allows for installation on the same resource, cluster, and network as the upstream target APIs, delivering sub-second response times.
