The following list provides configurable wrapper properties for Mule 3 that you can include in your `$MULE_HOME/conf/wrapper.conf` file:

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Property |Description | Default Value
|`anypoint.platform.client_id` | Client ID to be validated against `anypoint.platform.coreservice_base_uri`. Encrypted values require an `anypoint.platform.encryption_key` property, for example, `![rOgginfvFur5bs8RNhTPrg==]` |
|`anypoint.platform.client_secret` | Secret to be validated against `anypoint.platform.coreservice_base_uri`. Encrypted values require an `anypoint.platform.encryption_key` property, for example, `![qxsvR6rarv/gJdH11mWVgA==]` |
|`anypoint.platform.enable_api_gateway` | Flag that enables gateway-entitled modules in the case that the client ID or client secret are not defined | false
|`anypoint.platform.platform_base_uri` | Represents the URL to which the agent reports its status, for example, `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform+` |
|`anypoint.platform.coreservice_base_uri` | Represents the URL to which the agent reports its status, for example, `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts+` |
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri` | Represents the URL where the gateway posts analytics status and metrics, for example, `+https://analytics-ingest.anypoint.mulesoft.com+` |
|`anypoint.platform.proxy_host` | The host of the proxy for communications with Anypoint Platform, for example, `myorg.proxy.net` |
|`anypoint.platform.proxy_port` | The port of the proxy for communications with Anypoint Platform, for example, `8080` |
|`anypoint.platform.proxy_username` | The username used to authenticate against the proxy, for example, `myproxyuser` |
|`anypoint.platform.proxy_password` | The password used to authenticate against the proxy, for example, `myproxypass`. Encrypted values require an `anypoint.platform.encryption_key` property, for example, `![PVJYfVINSF8IzRKsNwmxMg==]` |
|`anypoint.platform.poll_policies_freq` | Interval between each poll for new policies from API platform. Time is expressed in seconds. | 60 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.api_keep_alive_freq` | Interval between each keep-alive notification to API platform. Time is expressed in seconds. | 15 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.retry_failed_apis_freq` | Interval between reattempts to track untracked APIs. Time is expressed in seconds | 15 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.gatekeeper` | Blocks traffic to tracked APIs until all policies retrieved from platform are applied successfully.

* `strict` or `true` +
APIs are blocked until the platform policies are applied. +
* `flexible` +
Default value that behaves the same as `strict`, but in the case of downtime, this setting tries to use local backup, if it is available. +
* `disabled` or `false` +
APIs are never blocked. |
|`anypoint.platform.on_prem` | Configures the gateway instance to run in `on_prem` mode. Setting this flag activates the following fields:

* `anypoint.platform.platform_base_uri` +

* `anypoint.platform.coreservice_base_uri` +
The mandatory fields enable you to run the solutions on-premises, inside your organization. Default is false |
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_enabled` | This flag enables or disables analytics statistics. If this property is enabled and `anypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri` is not an URL then, `analyticsQueue` and `analyticsProlicyViolationsQueue` are exposed through Mule registry in the properties `_analyticsQueue` and `_analyticsPolicyViolationQueue` | true
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_push_freq` | Time elapsed between each push to analytics. Time is expressed in seconds.| 5 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_cache_capacity` | Cache capacity of the analytics events stored in the internal `mapDB` used for analytics.| 50000
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_cache_file` | The name of the analytics report file.| `api-platform-analytics.db`
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_policy_violations_file` | The name of the analytics policy violations report file.| `api-platform-analytics-policy-violations`
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_policy_violations_cache_capacity` | Cache capacity of the analytics policy violations events stored in the internal `mapDB` used for analytics.| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_policy_violations_push_freq` | Time elapsed between each push to analytics reporting policy violations. Time is expressed in seconds.| 5 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_policy_violations_threshold` | Upper bound to policy violations. If the same policy (`policyId`) is violated more than the number of times between each push to analytics, then the message is discarded and logged.| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_batch_size` | Upper bound number of messages to be sent to analytics at once. Each pushes the gateway instance to the max number of analytics events per request that the gateway can send to analytics.| 500000
|`throttling.persistence_enabled` | This flag enables or disables persistence of the throttling quota.| true
|`throttling.persistent_data_update_freq` | Time elapsed between each dump of the throttling quota state to disk. Time is expressed in seconds.| 15 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.x_forwarded_headers_propagation` | Allows generation of `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers.| true
|`anypoint.platform.ping_federate_cache_max_size` | Upper bound number of tokens cached for the ping federate policy.| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.openid_connect_cache_max_size` | Upper bound number of tokens cached for the `openId` policy.| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.open_am_cache_max_size` | Upper bound number of tokens cached for the open AM policy.| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.oauth2_cache_max_size` | Upper bound number of tokens cached for the OAuth 2 policy. From versions 3.8.7 and 3.9.2 onwards (in previous versions, `-oauth2Cache`).| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.proxy_filter_mule_headers` | When using auto-generated proxies, this option enables or disables the filtering headers that start with `mule_` before sending them to the endpoint behind the backend.| true
|`anypoint.platform.encryption_key` | The key used the decrypt the encrypted properties, `anypoint.platform.client_id`, `anypoint.platform.client_secret` and `anypoint.platform.proxy_password` support encrypted values. To encrypt the values use the xref:mule-runtime::secure-configuration-properties.adoc[Secure Properties Tool].|
