Anypoint Connectors are extensions of Mule that let you work with external systems such as Salesforce,
ServiceNow, Workday, Twitter, and more to send and receive information from these systems to create something new.

Anypoint Connectors let you connect Mule applications to APIs and resources. You can use connectors within your
Mule applications to send and receive data over a protocol, or to and from an API.

You can create applications in Anypoint Studio by installing a connector from Anypoint Exchange,
and then dragging the connector to the Studio canvas.

When you add a connector to the start of a flow, it's known as a message processor or "trigger"
because it starts the Mule flow by receiving information from the connector's resource. For example,
when a Salesforce user updates a sales opportunity, the connector application can receive
the information and direct it to a database or to another connector for processing.

You can also use the HTTP connector as a message processor so that users can send information to your
Studio application using a web browser, Postman, or the `curl` command.

The list of https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=Mule%203&type=connector[Mule 3 connectors in Exchange]
provide descriptions and helpful links that help you understand how each works.

You can also use different operations from the same connector in a project. One operation can receive data,
another can process the data.

In addition, Exchange provides Mule 3 https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=Mule%203&type=template[templates] and https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=Mule%203&type=example[examples] that let you jump start application development.
