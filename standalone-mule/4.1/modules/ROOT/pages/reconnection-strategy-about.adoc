When an operation in a Mule application fails to connect to an external server, the default behavior is for the operation to fail immediately and return a connectivity error.

For example, if an operation in Anypoint Connector for FTP (FTP Connector) fails to connect to an FTP server, the operation throws an `FTP:CONNECTIVITY` error. The error name reflects the namespace that is specific to the connector, such as `FTP:CONNECTIVITY`, `HTTP:CONNECTIVITY`, or `DB:CONNECTIVITY` (for Anypoint Connector for Database (Database Connector).

You can modify this default behavior by configuring a reconnection strategy for the operation.

== Configure an Operation Reconnection Strategy

You can configure a reconnection strategy for an operation either by modifying the operation properties or by modifying the configuration of the global element for the operation. For example, you can configure a reconnection strategy in an HTTP Request configuration:

image::mruntime-reconnection-strategy.png[Configure a reconnection strategy]

The following are the available reconnection strategies and their behaviors:

* *None*
+
Is the default behavior, which immediately returns a connectivity error if the attempt to connect is unsuccessful
* *Standard* (`reconnect`)
+
Sets the number of reconnection attempts and the interval at which to execute them before returning a connectivity error
* *Forever* (`reconnect-forever`)
+
Attempts to reconnect continually at a given interval

== Example XML Reconnection Strategy Configurations

The following examples show different types of reconnection strategies and their configurations:

* Standard reconnection strategy example
+
The following example illustrates a Standard reconnection strategy in an FTP connector configuration, setting the count of reconnection attempts before failing to `5` and setting `failsDeployment` to `true`, which causes the application deployment to fail if the connection test fails. Because a frequency is not specified, the retry interval is the default of every 2000 ms:

----
<ftp:config name="FTP_Config" doc:name="FTP Config" >
  <ftp:connection host="ftp.someftphost.com" port="21" username="myusername" password="mypassword" >
    <reconnection failsDeployment="true" >
      <reconnect count="5"/>
    </reconnection>
  </ftp:connection>
</ftp:config>
<flow name="reconnectionsFlow" >
  <ftp:listener doc:name="On New or Updated File" config-ref="FTP_Config">
    <scheduling-strategy >
      <fixed-frequency />
    </scheduling-strategy>
  </ftp:listener>
</flow>
----
* Forever reconnection strategy example
+
The following example sets a Forever reconnection strategy in an FTP connector configuration by which the connector attempts to reconnect every 4000 ms for as long as the application runs:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<ftp:connection host="ftp.someftphost.com" port="21" username="myusername" password="mypassword" >
  <reconnection>
    <reconnect-forever frequency="4000"/>
  </reconnection>
</ftp:connection>

== Reconnection Strategy Reference

Following are the different configuration attributes for each reconnection strategy you can configure by editing your Mule application's XML configuration file:

* Attributes of `<reconnection>`
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|`failsDeployment` |boolean |no |false | If `true`, causes the deployment to fail when the test connection fails
|===
* Attributes of `<reconnect>`
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|`blocking` |boolean |no |true |If `false`, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, nonblocking thread
|`frequency` |long |no |2000 |How often (in ms) to reconnect
|`count` |integer |no |2 |How many reconnection attempts to make
|===
* Child Elements of `<reconnect>`
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|`abstract-reconnect-notifier` |0..1 |A placeholder for a reconnection notifier element +
The RetryNotifier interface is a callback that allows actions to be performed after each reconnection attempt, for example, firing server notification events on success or failure.
|===
* Attributes of `<reconnect-forever>`
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|`blocking` |boolean |no |true |If `false`, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, nonblocking thread.
|`frequency` |long |no |2000 |Specifies how often (in ms) to reconnect.
