For your Mule 3 apps to take advantage of Mule 4, migrate them to Mule 4 through one of the following processes:

* A fully manual migration of connectors, modules, transports, expressions, and API gateways to their Mule 4 counterparts.
+
For guidance with a fully manual migration, see xref:migration-prep.adoc[Prepare to Migrate] and review xref:migration-process.adoc[Manual Migration Process].
+
* A partially automated migration with the Mule Migration Assistant (MMA), which is available as an open source project on GitHub.
+
For guidance using MMA to assist in a migration, see the https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-migration-assistant/blob/master/docs/migration-intro.adoc#understand-the-mma-migration-process[user documentation (on GitHub)^]. MuleSoft suggests that you try MMA to determine whether you prefer it to a fully manual migration. Note that you can run MMA on a sample application by following steps in the https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-migration-assistant/blob/master/docs/user-docs/migration-tutorial.adoc[Migration Tutorial (on GitHub)^].

//BENEFITS
A benefit of using MMA is that it automates part of the migration of Mule 3 apps to Mule 4. Though the MMA does not migrate the app entirely, it provides significant help with the following tasks:

* Migrating the project structure.
* Automatically creating descriptor files, such as `pom.xml` or `mule-artifact.json`.
* Automatically performing many adaptations of the appâ€™s code.
* Providing guidance on how to manually migrate components and patterns that cannot be migrated automatically.

MMA helps with such tasks, but it does not deliver a fully functional app. Some additional steps are required. Those steps include testing and can also include:

* Manual migration of unsupported components.
* Manual migration of complex MEL expressions to DataWeave that cannot be automatically converted by MMA.
* Manual migration of complex DataWeave transformations that cannot be automatically converted by MMA.
* Prior migration of the DataMapper with the DataWeave Migration tool, before running the MMA.

It is also important to note that the MMA does not support incremental migrations.
